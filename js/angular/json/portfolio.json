I was matched with the VR team, whose team leader decided to create an escape room game. After brainstorming ideas, we decided to create a sci-fi-themed escape room game where the player was captured by aliens and trapped inside a spaceship. We collaborated on assets and code using PlasticSCM, an industry-standard version control tool for game development, and we used Unity3D game engine, C#, and Blender during the development. In this project, I have touched on various aspects of game development, including 3D modeling and editing, animations, audio, programming game logic, and optimizing the game. I also used a little bit of ProBuilder, a built-in Unity tool for level design."
